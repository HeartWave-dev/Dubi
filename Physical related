So once you completed level 1 (hardware related) you are now ready for physical related safety, im also gonna drop some street smart knowledge on here.

Ok so rule n1; never have more than one device on you. Police can miss match any info from devices to identify your persona with different identites you have previously created, giving your efforts up and possibly
getting you arrested and charged.
